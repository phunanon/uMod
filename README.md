# Î¼Mod

A moderation bot I made so I could kick Carlbot, but which now has now become quite featureful.

- Auto-Moderation
  - **InviteSpam**: auto-timeout users who post invites, and kick those who post invites and ping @everyone
  - **PingSpam**: auto-timeout users who ping more than one role or user in one message
  - **PermaRole**: ensures roles are restored even if somebody leaves and joins
  - **WhitelistChannel**: disables different kinds of auto-moderation for a channel
  - **SingleMessage**: enforces one message per user in a channel
  - **BlockGifs**: deletes messages with gifs from specified channels
  - **Censor**: deletes messages with blacklisted words or phrases and replaces them with a censored message
  - **PingProtect**: warn then timeout users who ping a user who has chosen to be protected
  - **GifMute**: remove the ability to send gifs from messages of particular users
  - **KickSus**: a suite of heuristics that warns a user then kicks them if they continue
    - FastSpam - ten messages in 30 sec
    - PingSpam - eight mentions in 30 sec
    - BigSpam - three long or tall messages in 30 sec
    - ChannelSpam - four of the same message in different channels in 5 min
    - SameLinkSpam - three of the same link in 5 min
    - SameMessageSpam - six of the same message in 5 min
    - MediaSpam - five media messages in 5 min
- Manual Moderation
  - **Tickets**: a ticket system for users to ask for help
    - Allows adding users to the ticket
  - **Note**: attaches notes to a user that all moderators can see
    - Notes are automatically attached for audit logs (ban, unban, kick, timeout, channel ban)
  - **MirrorGuild**: mirrors messages from entire guild into one channel
  - **Purge**: deletes a number of messages in a channel
  - **ChannelBan**: prevents a user from sending messages in a channel
    - these are automatically restored if the user leaves and joins again
  - **Alerts**: sends a message to a channel reacting to a specific event
    - Events: join, leave, role assignment, role restoration, moderation note, moderator action (ban, unban, kick, timeout, channel ban), first message in server, join VC, leave VC, membership milestone
    - Criteria: user ID, role ID, message pattern
    - Optionally with a custom alert message with tokens: `$content, $url, $tag, $user, $ping`
    - Optionally with a cooldown
    - Also **DeleteAlert**, **DeleteAlerts**, and **RecommendedAlerts**
  - **GuildMods**: assign moderator roles for your guild
    - Only the guild owner can use this command
  - **TempRole**: assign a role to a user for a specified amount of time
  - **DisallowRole**: prevent a user from having a role
- Fun
  - **Leaderboard**: keeps track of user messages and ranks them
  - **Confess**: repeats a message in a channel, anonymously
    - Also **ConfessMute**
  - **GlobalChat**: mirrors messages between guilds using public or private rooms
    - Includes message editing, deleting, and typing indication
  - **Histogram**: generates a histogram of hourly and week daily message counts for a user or the guild
  - **Acquaintances**: analyses the top three of who each user spends the most time talking to in chat
  - **QotD**: allows people to submit questions, moderators to approve them, and then sends one out daily
  - **FakeUser**: generates a message for a user that uses words and phrases they have previously said
- Useful
  - **AutoRole**: assigns a role to a user when they join
  - **Ping**: replies with "Pong!"
  - **StickyMessage**: periodically resends a message to a channel
  - **ActivitySort**: sorts channels in a category by recent activity
  - **RoleList**: maintains a message with a list of members with a role
  - **MutualTimeout**: allows anybody to mute another user but only if they are muted in return
    - Disabled in code by default
  - **Transcript**: sends a CSV transcript of a channel to a channel
  - **BumpReminder**: reminds users to bump on Disboard in a channel

Aspirations & TODO:

- Command to close ticket in a day
- Confess IDs that are unique per confession
- GlobalChat first message introduction
- caching for various things
- auto role
- global chat mute message context function
- /timestamp
- multiple tickets by putting a suffix on channel name
- allow censored messages through GlobalChat
- ability to send alerts in the channel they were triggered by
- different handler for registering slash commands which is only called via process.env
- subscribe to Qotd
- ticket custom reasons

## To host it yourself

Instructions for Node.js, in the terminal:

```
npm i -g pm2                       # Keeps the bot running even if it crashes
npm ci                             # Installs exact dependencies
npx prisma migrate dev             # Migrates the database and generates client
pm2 start out/index.js --name uMod # Starts up the bot
```

Though, you could probably instead use Bun.
